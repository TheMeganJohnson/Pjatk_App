# Repository Structure Diagnostic

Based on the Render logs, it seems like your repository structure might be:

```
Pjatk_App/
├── (some other directories)
└── CK_Mobile_App/
    ├── requirements.txt ❌ (Render can't find this)
    ├── myproject/ ❌ (Render can't find this)
    └── (other Flutter files)
```

But Render expects:
```
Pjatk_App/ (root)
├── requirements.txt ✅
├── myproject/ ✅
│   ├── manage.py
│   ├── manual_setup.py
│   └── (Django files)
└── (other files)
```

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Move Files to Repository Root
Move these files from `CK_Mobile_App/` to the repository root:
- requirements.txt
- myproject/ (entire directory)
- RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md

### Option 2: Update Render Build Command
Change the build command to account for the subdirectory:

**Updated Build Command (without manual_setup.py):**
```
cd CK_Mobile_App && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd myproject && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**Start Command (unchanged):**
```
cd CK_Mobile_App/myproject && gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

## Current Status: ✅ Almost Working!
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Static files collected (125 files)
- Only missing the manual_setup.py file

## Recommended Action:
Try Option 2 first (update the build commands) since it requires no file reorganization.
