# Render GitHub Access Troubleshooting

## Step 1: Check Repository Visibility
1. Go to https://github.com/TheMeganJohnson/Pjatk_App
2. Check if the repository is:
   - ✅ Public (should work automatically)
   - ❌ Private (needs explicit permission)

## Step 2: Connect GitHub to Render
1. In Render Dashboard, go to Account Settings
2. Click on "Connected Accounts" 
3. Make sure GitHub is connected
4. If not connected:
   - Click "Connect GitHub"
   - Authorize Render to access your repositories

## Step 3: Repository Permissions
If your repo is private:
1. In Render, when creating the service
2. Click "Configure GitHub App"
3. Select which repositories Render can access
4. Add your specific repository

## Step 4: Alternative - Manual Deploy
If GitHub integration fails:
1. Download your repository as ZIP
2. In Render, choose "Deploy from Git repository"
3. Manually upload the ZIP file

## Step 5: Verify Repository URL
Make sure the repository URL is correct:
- Current: https://github.com/TheMeganJohnson/Pjatk_App
- Check if this URL is accessible and contains your code
